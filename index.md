This course is an introduction to the fundamental data structures of computer science: linked lists,
stacks, queues, trees (BSTs, heaps, AVLs and other self-balancing BSTs), hash tables,
sets (Union-Find), graphs and their accompanying algorithms. Principles of algorithmic
analysis and object reasoning and design will be introduced using mathematical techniques
for the notions of both complexity and correctness. More practical issues, such as memory
management, searching, sorting and hashing, will also be covered.
