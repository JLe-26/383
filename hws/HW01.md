## Overview

In this assignment, you will implement program mutations. Transforming a program automatically is important for many reasons: compiler optimizations, automatic refactorings, program reduction, and mutation testing (and more that I can't think of rn).

You will implement these at two levels of program representation: bytecode and AST. 

<br>

Implement the folllowing mutations:

1. Conditional Mutations: relational operator replacement
2. Method Call Mutations: replace the return value of non-void methods with default values
3. Statement Mutations: remove individual statements - tbh I don't like this one. I would prefer that they do something that requires adding statements so they have to build one up (similar to the performance logging. BUT they might get that in HW2 on  fuzzing where they need to add coverage statments).

## 1. Java Byte Code Mutations

### Warmup: Filling in Missing Bytecode

You will be given a java source file and its corresponding bytecode. Certain portions of the bytecode will be missing, marked with comments like `// PX: missing bytecode`. Your task is to analyze the provided source code and complete the missing bytecode. 

Source:
```java
public class MathExample {
    
    public int multiplyByTwo(int a) {
        return a * 2;
    }

    public int square(int b) {
        return b * b;
    }

    public int getMax(int x, int y) {
        return (x > y) ? x : y;
    }
}
```

Bytecode:
```java
// Method multiplyByTwo
public int multiplyByTwo(int a);
   0: iload_1
   1: iconst_2
   // P1: missing bytecode to multiply a by 2
   2: return

// Method square
public int square(int b);
   0: iload_1
   // P2: missing bytecode to multiply b by b
   1: return

// Method getMax
public int getMax(int x, int y);
   0: iload_1
   1: iload_2
   2: if_icmple  // P3: missing branch target
   3: iload_1
   4: goto       // P4: missing branch target
   5: iload_2
   6: return
```

Mark your answers in a file named `HW1_pt1.txt`.

You can check your answer using the `javap -c` command. 

### Byte Code Transformations

Now that you have a handle on java bytecode, let's write code to perform transformations to it. 

In this assignment, you will use the ASM library to read in, manipulate, and write java bytecode. 


As a first step, consider the bytecode of the following java program:

```java
INSERT JAVA CODE HERE
```

Remember that you can use `javap` to view the bytecode.

```java
BYTECODE HERE.
```

You will write three visitors. First, you will write a visitor to modify conditionals. Recall `pitest` from your mutation testing lab (idk about order here. The lab might go AFTER this homework).

You will implement the conditional boundry mutator (https://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators/#CONDITIONALS_BOUNDARY) shown here. A `<` and `<=` should be transformed to `>` and `>=` (respectively) and  `>` and `>=` should be transformed to `<` and `<=` (respectively).

Think about which bytecode instructions correspond to each conditional.

Now, manually write how the transformed bytecode of the above program would look.

Submit your visitor to gradescope. 


## 2. AST Mutations

## README.txt

In a text file called `README.txt` answer the following questions:

1. Time for bytecode transformations vs AST transformations
2. Any bytecode transformations that don't map to source?
