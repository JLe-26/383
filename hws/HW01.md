## Overview

In this assignment, you will implement program transformations at two levels:

- AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) level using the JavaParser library
- Bytecode level using the ASM library


A program transformation refers to the process of automatically converting a program from one form to another while preserving its intended behavior or semantics. Automatically transorming a program is useful in program optimizations, refactorings, and instrumentation. 

Your task is to manipulate a simple Java program to optimize method execution by inlining certain methods.

### Setup: Download Transformation Library Jars

1. JavaParser: `wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/javaparser/javaparser-core/3.25.1/javaparser-core-3.25.1.jar`  
2. ASM:
   * `wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm/9.5/asm-9.5.jar`
   * `wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/ow2/asm/asm-tree/9.5/asm-tree-9.5.jar`


## 1. Bytecode-Level Transformations with ASM

### Warmup: Filling in Missing Bytecode
You will be given a java source file and its corresponding bytecode. Certain portions of the bytecode will be missing, marked with comments like `// PX: missing bytecode`. Your task is to analyze the provided source code and complete the missing bytecode. 

Source:
```java
public class MathExample {
    
    public int multiplyByTwo(int a) {
        return a * 2;
    }

    public int square(int b) {
        return b * b;
    }

    public int getMax(int x, int y) {
        return (x > y) ? x : y;
    }
}
```

Bytecode:
```java
// Method multiplyByTwo
public int multiplyByTwo(int a);
   0: iload_1
   1: iconst_2
   // P1: missing bytecode to multiply a by 2
   2: return

// Method square
public int square(int b);
   0: iload_1
   // P2: missing bytecode to multiply b by b
   1: return

// Method getMax
public int getMax(int x, int y);
   0: iload_1
   1: iload_2
   2: if_icmple  // P3: missing branch target
   3: iload_1
   4: goto       // P4: missing branch target
   5: iload_2
   6: return
```

Mark your answers in a file named `warmup.txt`.

You can check your answer using the `javap -c` command. 

### Byte Code Transformations

Now that you have a handle on java bytecode, let's write code to perform transformations to it. 

**Task: Inline Small Methods**

Using the ASM library, you will transform the bytecode of a class to inline any methods that are small enough (e.g., methods that contain only a few bytecode instructions). Inlining is a common optimization that replaces a method call with the body of the method itself, avoiding the overhead of method invocation.
Steps:

1. Read the bytecode of the compiled Java class using ASM.
2. Identify methods (not constructors) that are small (less than 10 bytecode instructions).
3. Replace calls to these small methods with their inlined body in the bytecode. Be sure to consider the local variable table.
4. Write the modified bytecode back to a new .class file.

**Requirements:**
* The Java class to be transformed must be provided as a command line argument.
* The transformed bytecode should be written to a new file named xTransformed.class, where x is the name of the input class file (e.g., for an input file MyClass.class, the output file should be MyClassTransformed.class).
* Your implementation should be written in a file named `InlineTransformation.java`
* For simplicity, you may assume that each method you need to inline has a single callsite.
* You may also assume that methods to inline are not static and are not constructors.

**Example Input:**
```java
public class Example {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    public int calculate() {
        return add(2, 3);
    }
}
```

**Expected Bytecode Transformation:**

The method call to add(2, 3) in the calculate method should be replaced by the actual addition operation, avoiding the method call. 

More sample inputs are included in: `https://bmc-cs-software-analysis.github.io/383/hws/test.zip`.

**Note:** Expected outputs are intentionally omitted. Before implementation, examine the Java bytecode using `javap` and think through how the bytecode should look after inlining. Remember to compile the test files using `javac -g` to view the local variable table for each method.

Notice how each of the `Medium` samples differ from `Easy`. Even very simple language constructs like allowing parameters or non-void return types pose additional challenges for your inliner. Imagine writing one that supports the entire Java language!

* [VarInsnNode](https://asm.ow2.io/javadoc/org/objectweb/asm/tree/VarInsnNode.html)

## 2. AST-Level Transformation with JavaParser

**Task: Inline Small Methods** at the AST level.

Now you will repeat the same transformation but using a different program representation and library. You will use the JavaParser library, to inline methods at the AST level.

Steps:

1. Parse the provided Java source code using JavaParser.
2. Traverse the AST to locate method declarations that are small (less than 5 statements)
3. Replace calls to this method with the body of the method.
4. Write the modified AST back to a new `.java` file.

The requirements are similar to Part 1.
**Requirements:**
* The Java source file to be transformed must be provided as a command line argument.
* The transformed source should be written to a new file named xTransformed.java, where x is the name of the input class file (e.g., for an input file MyClass.java, the output file should be MyClassTransformed.java).
* Your implementation should be written in a file named InlineASTTransformation.java
* You can make the same assumptions as in the previous part. You may assume that each method you need to inline has a single callsite. You may also assume that methods to inline are not static and are not constructors.

Write your solution in a file named `InlineASTTransformation.java`

Use the same test files as the previous step.


**Resources**
* [JavaParser Documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.github.javaparser/javaparser-core/latest/index.html)
Some useful classes are `MethodDeclaration`, `VoidVisitor`, `ModifierVisitor`, `NameExpr`, and `MethodCallExpr`.

## Submission 

In a text file called `README.txt` answer the following questions:

1. List some language constructs for which your implementation will fail.
2. After inlining methods at both the AST and bytecode levels, how did the representation of the program differ in each case? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in terms of flexibility, ease of implementation, and control over the transformation? In what types of scenarios would one approach be preferred over the other, and why? 

Submit your `warmup.txt`, `InlineTransformation.java`, `InlineASTTransformation.java` and README to Gradescope.
