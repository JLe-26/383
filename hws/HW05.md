## Overview
For this assignment you will implement the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae. This assignment consists of four parts. The first part will involve querying Z3 Theorem Prover, a SMT solver developed by Microsoft. Part two will inolve converting propositions to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). You will work through examples by hand as well as programming a function to rewrite propositions in CNF. In Part three you will implement DPLL for boolean satisfiability. Since DPLL requires CNF propositions, you will use your function you wrote in part two. In part four, you will extend your DPLL algorithm to DPLL+Theory (DPLL+T) by implementing the Simplex Algorithm for Linear Algebra. 

## Resources
1. [Z3 Java Documentation](https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/classcom_1_1microsoft_1_1z3_1_1_context.html)
2. [Z3 Java Example](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/blob/master/examples/java/JavaExample.java)

## Part 1. Querying Z3

In this part, you will use the Java Z3 library to query if a proposition is satisfiable. 

Setup steps: 
1. Download the [latest z3 release](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases) - Download the latest zip file
2. unzip the release
3. cd into the newly unzip directory and run `mkdir bin`
4. Run `python scripts/mk_make.py --prefix=<your_z3_path>/bin --java` replacing `<your_z3_path>` with the absolute path to the directory you just unzipped.
5. run `cd build; make`
6. run `make install`. When this is done you should see a message that says "Z3 was successfully installed."
7. run `export Z3_DIR=<your_z3_path>` replacing `<your_z3_path>` with the absolute path to the directory you just unzipped.
8. run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$Z3_DIR/bin/lib`
9. Download the starter code for part 1: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BMC-CS-151/BMC-CS-151.github.io/main/hws/hw05/BinaryTree.java`
10. Compile it using `bash compile.sh` and run it using `bash run.sh`

### Declaring Propositions
In Z3, we declare propositions using the `Context mkBoolConst` function. The argument is the string name of that boolean variable. 

Open the given code to see an example of querying Z3 for a model of `(p V q) ^ (p V ~r)`. 
The code first creates a `Context` and `Solver`. It then creates Boolean consts for `p`, `q`, and `r`. Next it combines them using boolean operators with the `mkOr`, `mkAnd`, and `mkNot` methods. Lastly, it calls `solver.check()` to see if the given boolean proposition is satisfiable and `solver.getModel()` to return the satisfying assignment if it exists. 

### SAT or UNSAT
For each of the following propositions, use Z3 to decide if it is satisfiable. If it is satisfiable, report a valid interpretation. Otherwise, report UNSAT. 
1. ¬¬A
2. A∧¬A 
3. (A∨B)∧(¬A∨C)∧(¬B∨¬C)
4. (A∨B∨C)∧(¬A∨D)∧(¬B∨¬D)∧(C∨¬D)∧(A∨¬C)
5. (A∨B∨C)∧(¬A∨D)∧(¬B∨D)∧(¬C∨D)∧(¬D∨E)∧(A∨¬E)∧(B∨¬E)∧(C∨¬E)∧(¬A∨¬B)∧(¬B∨¬C)∧(¬A∨¬C)

For the following program, use Z3 decide if a divide by zero error may occur. 
Report the proposition you encoded as well as a valid interpretation if it is satisfiable.

You can assume x, y, and z are integers. Hint: you might want to use the `Context` methods: `mkIntConst`, `mkEq`, `mkGt` and similar.

```java
if (x > y) {
    int res = x / y;
}
```

```java
if (y > 3 * x + 7) {
    if (x + y - z % 2 == 0) {
        if (z >= x) {
            int res = z / (z - x);
        }
    }
}
```

When you're done with this section, submit your code `Hw5Part1.java` to gradescope.
In your READEME.txt report if the 7 given propositions are SAT/UNSAT and give a satisfying assignment if they are SAT.
