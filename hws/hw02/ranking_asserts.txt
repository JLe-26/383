PROMPT="Given the following code snippet, generate all possible assertions following the formal grammar rules. For each assertion, rank the list of all possible assertions. Code: testGetSources() { Set<File> sources = testMojo.getSources(); int size = sources.size(); <AssertPlaceHolder>; }"
Output: "In this code snippet, we have a placeholder for an assertion. Let's generate possible assertions based on the given context and the common assertion methods in JUnit. Here are some possible assertions, ranked from most common to less common:\n\n1.

Assert that the `sources` set contains a specific file:\n   ```\n   File expectedFile = new File(\"path/to/expected/file\");\n   Assertions.assertTrue(sources.contains(expectedFile));\n   ```\n\n4. Assert that the `sources` set does not contain a specific file:\n   ```\n   File unexpectedFile = new File(\"path/to/unexpected/file\");\n   Assertions.assertFalse(sources.contains(unexpectedFile));\n   ```\n\n5.

Test Prefix #2: values_reflectsChanges()
PROMPT="Given the following code snippet, generate all possible assertions following the formal grammar rules. For each assertion, rank the list of all possible assertions. Code: values_reflectsChanges() { List<JsonValue> values = array.values(); array.add(true); <AssertPlaceHolder>; }"
Output: "In this code snippet, we have a method `values_reflectsChanges()` that modifies a list of `JsonValue` objects by adding a new `true` value to the end. To generate assertions, we need to check the state of the list before and after the modification. Here are some possible assertions, ranked by their relevance and specificity:\n\n1. Assert that the list `array` has a length greater than its original length after the `add` operation:\n   ```\n   assert(values.size() > array.size());\n   ```\n\n2.

Assert that the last element of the original list `values` is not `true` before the `add` operation:\n   ```\n   assert(!values.get(values.size() - 1).equals(true));\n   ```\n\n4. Assert that the list `array` contains the value `true` after the `add` operation:\n   ```\n   assert(array.contains(true));\n   ```\n\n5. Assert that the original list `values` does not contain the value `true` before the `add` operation:\n   ```\n   assert(!values.contains(true));\n   ```\n\n6.

Test Prefix #3: testWithVariableColumns()
PROMPT="Given the following code snippet, generate all possible assertions following the formal grammar rules. For each assertion, rank the list of all possible assertions. Code: testWithVariableColumns() { final CsvConfig cfg = new CsvConfig(); cfg.withVariableColumns(false); boolean out = cfg.isVariableColumns(); <AssertPlaceHolder>; }"
Output: "In this code snippet, we have a method `testWithVariableColumns()` that initializes a `CsvConfig` object and sets the variable columns to `false`. The `out` boolean variable is set to the value of `cfg.isVariableColumns()`. The assertion will be placed at the `<AssertPlaceHolder>` position.\n\nSince the `CsvConfig` object's `variableColumns` property is set to `false` at the beginning of the method, the assertion should check that the `out` boolean variable also has the value `false`.\n\nHere are the possible assertions following the formal grammar rules:\n\n1. Assertion: `assert out == false;`\n   - Rank: 1 (most likely)\n\n2. Assertion: `assert !out;`\n   - Rank: 2 (less likely, but still valid due to the `!` operator)\n\n3. Assertion: `assert out.equals(false);`\n   - Rank: 3 (least likely, as the `==` operator is more commonly used for primitive boolean types)\n\n4. Assertion: `assert out.booleanValue() == false;`\n   - Rank: 4 (least likely, as the `booleanValue()` method is not necessary in this case)\n\nRanking the assertions from most likely to least likely:\n1. `assert out == false;`\n2. `assert !out;`\n3. `assert out.equals(false);`\n4. `assert out.booleanValue() == false;`"

Test Prefix #4: getDocument_nullXml()
PROMPT="Given the following code snippet, generate all possible assertions following the formal grammar rules. For each assertion, rank the list of all possible assertions. Code: getDocument_nullXml() { billingData.setResultXML(null); Document document = billingData.getDocument(); <AssertPlaceHolder>; }"
Output: "In this code snippet, we have a method `getDocument_nullXml()` that sets the `resultXML` of `billingData` to `null` and then attempts to retrieve a `Document` object from `billingData`. We can generate assertions based on the expected behavior of the method and the state of the objects involved. Here are some possible assertions, ranked in order of increasing specificity:\n\n1. `assert billingData.getDocument() == null`\n   - This assertion checks if the `getDocument()` method returns `null`, which is expected since we set `billingData.setResultXML(null)` before retrieving the document.\n\n2. `assert billingData.getDocument() instanceof Document`\n   - This assertion checks if the returned object is an instance of `Document`. This is a basic type check to ensure that the method is returning an object of the expected type.\n\n3. `assert billingData.getResultXML() == null`\n   - This assertion checks if the `resultXML` of `billingData` is still `null` after the `getDocument()` method is called. This could be useful if there's a possibility that the method might alter the state of `billingData` in an unexpected way.\n\n4. `assert billingData.getResultXML() instanceof String`\n   - This assertion checks if the `resultXML` of `billingData` is a string, which is the expected type since it's being set to `null` (a string of length 0).\n\n5. `assert billingData != null`\n   - This assertion checks if `billingData` is not `null`. This is a basic check to ensure that the object exists before we attempt to call methods on it.\n\n6. `assert billingData.getClass() == <ExpectedClass>`\n   - This assertion checks if `billingData` is an instance of the expected class. This could be useful if you're dealing with a complex hierarchy of classes and want to ensure that the correct class is being used. Replace `<ExpectedClass>` with the actual expected class name.\n\n7. `assert billingData.hashCode() == <ExpectedHashCode>`\n   - This assertion checks if the hash code of `billingData` matches an expected value. This is less common but could be useful in certain situations where you want to ensure that a specific object is being used. Replace `<ExpectedHashCode>` with the actual expected hash code."

Output: "In this code snippet, we have a method `shouldEqualGivenSelf()` that creates an `OrderedSet` of objects and checks if it equals itself. To generate assertions, we'll fill in the `<AssertPlaceHolder>` with various possible assertions. Here are some examples, ranked in order of increasing specificity and complexity:\n\n1. Assert that the `equals` boolean is `true`:\n   ```\n   assertTrue(equals);\n   ```\n\n2. Assert that the `orderedSet` is not empty:\n   ```\n   assertFalse(orderedSet.isEmpty());\n   ```\n\n3.
