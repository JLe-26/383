## Objectives:

The main goals for this lab are:
1. Get practice using a checkstyle
1. Work with Stacks
1. Get started with JUnit

You will need to have a TA check off on all your exercises.
If you do not complete the lab during the lab session, you
must have a TA check off all your exercises during office hours.
You must get this lab checked off by the due date for HW04.

## Exercise 1 - Checkstyle

During today's class we introduced checkstyle. Checkstyle is an open-sourced tool that 
allows one to easily check whether their code complies with customizable rules.

Your task is to modify `LookupZip.java` from `lecture07` so that the checkstyle passes.

Getting Started:
1. Download the xml checkstyle from the course GitHub repository: ```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BMC-CS-151/class-examples-f23/main/cs151_checks.xml```
2. Download the checkstyle-8.16 jar file from here: https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/releases/tag/checkstyle-8.16 
3. Run 
	```java -jar checkstyle-8.16-all.jar â€“c  cs151_checks.xml LookupZip.java```
to see the checkstyle errors.
4. Modify `LookupZip.java` until the above command runs without any errors.

## Exercise 2 - PostfixEvaluator.java

Download `PostfixEvaluator.java` from 
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BMC-CS-151/BMC-CS-151.github.io/main/labs/lab05/PostfixEvaluator.java`
This is an implementation of the postfix evaluator we discussed in class with the built-in Java `Stack`.
Look through the code to understand how it work. Run `PostfixEvaluator.java` to interact with it a bit.

### Exercise 2.1 - Testing PostfixEvaluator
Run the tests we provide in `TestPostFixEvaluator`.

You can download `TestPostfixEvaluator.java` from 
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BMC-CS-151/BMC-CS-151.github.io/main/labs/lab05/TestPostfixEvaluator.java`

**Make sure the checkstyle passes for `TestPostfixEvaluator.java`**.
When you run the checkstyle for `TestPostfixEvaluator` you will see `7` errors. Fix all them
and then continue.

Once the test file passes the checkstyle, you will run the tests. To run the tests,
you will need to make sure you download two jar files:
1. junit-4.13.2.jar - `wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/junit/junit/4.13.2/junit-4.13.2.jar`
1. hamcrest-core-1.13.jar - `wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hamcrest/hamcrest-core/1.3/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar`

To compile and run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
javac -cp .:junit-4.13.2.jar  TestPostfixEvaluator.java
java -cp "./junit-4.13.2.jar:./hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:./" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestPostfixEvaluator
```

You can alternatively use the `run_junit.sh` script I created in class: https://github.com/BMC-CS-151/class-examples-s24/blob/main/lec07/Stacks/run_junit.sh

Test it using TestPostfixEvaluator.java. Make sure you understand how it works.

Now, add 4 more tests to `TestPostfixEvaluator`. The tests should each combine multiple operators.

### Exercise 2.2 - Modifying PostfixEvaluator

Copy `PostFixEvaluator.java` to a new file called `PostfixStringEvaluator.java`.
Modify `PostfixStringEvaluator.java` to convert a postfix expression to a parenthesized infix 
expression and display it to the user. Modifications to `PostfixStringEvaluator.java` should not be
extensive. The only difference is that when encountering an operator, instead of pushing the
result of the arithmetic operation involving this operator and the top two operands onto the
stack, i.e. a number, you will consruct the string representing that arithmetic operation and
push the string onto the stack instead. Below are some examples:

```
Sample Input 1
5 6 + 9 *
Output
( ( 5 + 6 ) * 9 )
Sample Input 2
8 9 10 + *
Output
( 8 * ( 9 + 10 ) )
```

Make sure `PostFixStringEvaluator.java` complies with the style guide.

### Exercise 2.3 - Testing PostfixStringEvaluator
We provide three tests in `TestPostfixStringEvaluator`. 

You can download `TestPostfixStringEvaluator.java` from 
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BMC-CS-151/BMC-CS-151.github.io/main/labs/lab05/TestPostfixStringEvaluator.java`

Again, make sure that `TestPostfixStringEvaluator.java` passes the checkstyle.
There will be `7` checkstyle errors in the file we are providing you.

Now add 4 more tests, make them a bit complicated.

## Excercise 3 - DoubleStack

Now we are going to implement 2 stacks using 1 array.

Imlement a `DoubleStack` class using a single underlying array 
that stores two different stacks (stack 1 and stack 2).
One of the stacks grows upwards
from index 0 upward, and the other stacks grows from the end of the array down. So these two stacks
grow towards each other. Unlike `ExpandableArray` you can have empty spaces in your data structure.

The top indexes are denoted by `top1` and `top2` for stack 1 and
stack 2, respectively. Thus, the `DoubleStack` class should have three instance variables: 

1. E[] theArray, 
1. int top1,
1. int top2

Make sure `theArray` locations 0 to top1 contain elements in stack 1 and theArray locations
theArray.length-1 downto top2 stores the elements in stack 2. You can assume a max stack size of 100 for each stack.

### Methods to implement

Implement the following methods.

If the runtime of any of the methods besides for `printStack` is not
`O(1)`, you are writing unnecessary loops.

Before implementing the tests, make sure to create a test fille called `TestDoubleStack.java`
that uses JUnit tests.

#### 3.1 void push(int stackId, E e): 
push e onto stack stackId (1 or 2). In other words, it
will push onto stack 1 if stackId==1 and onto stack 2 if stackId==2. Throw an
`IllegalStateException` if stack is full. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the stackId is not 1 or 2. 

#### 3.2 E pop(int stackId): 
pop from stackId, return null if empty. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the stackId is not 1 or 2. 

#### 3.3 E top(int stackId): 
top element from stackId, return null if empty. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the stackId is not 1 or 2. 


#### 3.4  int size(int stackId): 
return size of stack stackId. Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the stackId is not 1 or 2. 

#### 3.5  boolean isEmpty(int stackId) 
Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the stackId is not 1 or 2. 

#### 3.6  String printStack(int stackId)
Throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the stackId is not 1 or 2. 

## Wrap up

In todays lab we covered checkstyle, stacks, and unit testing.

### Signing out
Before leaving, make sure your TA/instructor have signed you out of the lab. If you finish the lab early, you are free to go.
If you do not finish the lab in time, you will need to go to office hours so
that a TA can check your work.
