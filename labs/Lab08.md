You will be submitting this lab to Gradescope. 

## Objectives:

The main goals for this lab are:
1. Get practice with binary trees
1. Get more practice using checkstyle, JUnit, and implementing an interface


### Paired Programming rules
This lab is a **paired programming assignment.** What exactly does that mean? 
You will be working in pairs on the CS lab computers. Each pair will be working on one computer. One person will be the **driver** and the other person
 will be the **navigator**. Here is the rule: the **driver** controlls the lab computer, but the **driver** can only type what the **navigator** tells 
them to type. For this to work well, each pair should be constantly talking 
among themselves. After each problem, you will switch roles, the navigator will become the driver and the driver will become the navigator.


For both exercises, you can assume a max array capacity of 100 that will not need to expand. 

## Exercise 1 - ArrayBinaryTree
Download the `LabBinaryTree` interface from 
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BMC-CS-151/BMC-CS-151.github.io/main/labs/lab08/LabBinaryTree.java`


Design and implement `ArrayBinaryTree` that 
implements `LabBinaryTree`. 
Note that different from last week's lab and homework 05,
this is now an array-based binary tree. 

Also note that you only need
to implement a binary tree, not a binary search tree (in the sense that each node can have
max two children, but no ordering of any kind is enforced, between the parent/children, or
among the siblings). Think about what instance variables you will need.

**Your ArrayBinaryTree should be complete and all operations should maintain completeness**

Start with the methods `size` and `isEmpty`. 
Implement the suggested helper methods below
before moving onto `insert` and 
`toStringBreadthFirst`, 
which prints out the elements of
the binary tree in breadth first traversal order (layer-by-layer). Breadth-first traversal should be straight forward
when you have an array-based binary tree. For `insert`, make sure your tree maintains completeness post insertion. 

Create a default constructor which initializes your array and sets it to a sufficiently large capacity. 

1. `int parent(int i);` - returns the index of the parent of child stored at i
2. `int left(int i);` - returns index of left child of parent stored at i
3. `int right(int i);` returns index of right child of parent stored at i
4. `void swap(int i, int j);` - swaps the two nodes stored at indices i and j
5. `int containsIdx(E element);` - returns the index of the node containing element. If the element does not exist in the tree, return -1. 

Now, implement `insert` and `toStringBreadthFirst`. 



###  Testing
In a file called `TestArrayBinaryTree.java`,
write JUnit tests test your methods. 
Remember to thorougly test each method. 

Then, in `ArrayBinaryTree.java`,
write a main method where you create an
`ArrayBinaryTree<Integer>` object
and insert the integers 1-20 into the tree.
Use the `toStringBreadthFirst()` method
to print out the object. 

### Remove & getRootElement
Proceed with implementing `getRootElement` and `remove`. Ensure your `remove`  method maintains completeness of the binary tree. Hint: use `swap`

Make sure to add JUnit tests that sufficiently test `getRootElement` and `remove`.

## Exercise 2 - ArrayHeap
Download the `LabPriorityQueue.java` interface from 
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BMC-CS-151/BMC-CS-151.github.io/main/labs/lab08/LabPriorityQueue.java`

Implement `ArrayHeap` as a **Min** Heap that extends `ArrayBinaryTree` and 
implements `LabPriorityQueue`. Start with overriding `insert` so
that elements can be inserted in heap order. Next override `remove` so post removal, the properties of heap order are maintained. 

Proceed with implementing `peek` and `poll`

Make sure to write JUnit tests that sufficiently test the new methods
in `ArrayHeap`.
