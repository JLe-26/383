## Objectives:

The main goals for this lab are:
1. Getting practice with AVL Trees and Rotations


### Paired Programming rules
This lab is a **paired programming assignment.** What exactly does that mean? 
You will be working in pairs on the CS lab computers. Each pair will be working on one computer. One person will be the **driver** and the other person
 will be the **navigator**. Here is the rule: the **driver** controlls the lab computer, but the **driver** can only type what the **navigator** tells 
them to type. For this to work well, each pair should be constantly talking 
among themselves. After each problem, you will switch roles, the navigator will become the driver and the driver will become the navigator.


## Exercise
In this assignment you will write a AVLTree (`AVLTree.java`) that extends your LinkedBinaryTree from HW05.
Your AVLTree should be generic over type `E`. 
First, copy over your `LinkedBinaryTree.java` and the `BinaryTree.java` interface from HW05. 
Then, modify the `Node` class in `LinkedBinaryTree` to have `public` access. 

### 1 
Add a `parent` reference and a `height` instance variable to the `Node` class of 
`LinkedBinaryTree`. Also add public methods `Node<E> getParent()`, `int getHeight()`, `E getData()`, `Node<E> getLeft()`, and `Node<E> getRight()` for testing. 
Inheritance of inner/nested classes of Java could be weird so it’s easier to just make changes
to the `Node` in `LinkedBinaryTree` instead. 

`getHeight()` should return the height of the subtree rooted at that node. A leaf node should have a height of 1. 

### 2
Modify/override `LinkedBinaryTree` and/or `AVLTree` so that `parent` and `height`
are set correctly on `insertion` and `deletion`. 
You might need additional helper methods (to compute
`height`, for example).

### 3
Add the following methods / constructors to `AVLTree.java`   
`public Node getRoot()`   
`public AVLTree()`  
`public AVLTree(E data)`  

### 4
Override `toString` of the `Node` class to print the element followed by its 
`height` in parenthesis.

### 5
Modify/Override `toStringInOrder` so that it uses the above `toString` of `Node`
and returns a traversal string listing the elements with `height` attached.

### 6
Implement `public Node rebalance()` with associated helpers (`public Node rotateLeft(Node n)`, `public Node rotateRight(Node n)`, `public Node rotateLeftRight(Node n)`,
`public Node rotateRightLeft(Node n)`) and call appropriately on insertion. `rotateLeftRight` and `rotateRightLeft` should take the root that we want to perform the second rotation over. 

### 7 - Testing
Create an `AVLTree<String>` and insert the exercise example given in class, i.e. “M”, “N”,
“O”, “L”, “K”, “Q”, “P”, “H”, “I”, “A”. Draw the expected tree by hand and assert that your code does indeed create the expected tree. 

### 8 
Override `toString` of `AVLTree` to print out the in-order traversal, with the height of each
node attached. For example, the tree above should return the following string:

```
A(1) H(2) I(3) K(1) L(2) M(1) N(4) O(1) P(2) Q(1)
```
