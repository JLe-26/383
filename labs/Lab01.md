## Objectives:

In this lab, you will:

1. Review JUnit and how to use it effectively.
2. Consider what makes a good test suite and how to strengthen it. 

In this course we will explore various techniques for checking software correctness. As we saw in class, each method comes with its own tradeoffs, balancing cost, and the level of confidence they provide.

In today's lab we will focus on one of the simplest and most flexible methods: ad-hoc testing. 

Ad-hoc testing is an informal testing approach where testers explore the application on the fly by writing test cases non systematically. The main goal is to find defects quickly by relying on intuition, experience, and understanding of the system. In this lab, you'll write unit tests for code to parse integers and dates. As you work, reflect on what factors makes a test suite effective.

## JUnit Review and Setup

JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java, designed to facilitate the creation and execution of tests for individual "units" of code, typically methods. JUnit provides libraries for writing tests and assertions and a framework for executing those tests and confirming their results.

Download the JUnit and Hamcrest jars:

### Setup Instructions

To get started, download the following jar files:

1. junit-4.13.2.jar:
`wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/junit/junit/4.13.2/junit-4.13.2.jar`
2. hamcrest-core-1.13.jar: 
`wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hamcrest/hamcrest-core/1.3/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar`

To run JUnit, first compile the test file, then run your suite using the following two commands:

```bash
javac -cp .:junit-4.13.2.jar  TestFile.java
java -cp "./junit-4.13.2.jar:./hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:./" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestFile
```

Alternatively, you can use the `run_junit.sh` script I created which simplifies this process. You can find it here: https://github.com/BMC-CS-151/class-examples-s24/blob/main/lec07/Stacks/run_junit.sh

The script takes the test filename (without the .java extension) as a command line argument:

```bash
bash run_junit.sh TestFile
```

Ensure your jar files are in the current working directory, or modify the classpath accordingly.

## 1. Testing ParseInt

To begin, download the following files:
- Source file: `wget https://bmc-cs-software-analysis.github.io/383/labs/lab01/StringToInteger.java`
- Starter test file: `wget https://bmc-cs-software-analysis.github.io/383/labs/lab01/TestStringToInteger.java`

Take note of the imports and the `@Test` annotation in the starter test file. 

The `assertEquals` method is used to compare the expected value with the actual value produced by your code.

JUnit offers a variety of assertion types for different testing needs. For more details, you can read the documentation here: https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.13/org/junit/Assert.html

### Your Task: 

Your goal is to add tests for the parseInt method. As you write your tests, consider the following questions:

1. How do you determine when you have tested enough cases?
2. What criteria did you use to select your input values?
3. How did you derive your assertions, and how did you establish what the expected values should be?

Once you feel confident that your tests are comprehensive, proceed to the next section.

## 2. Parsing Dates 

In this part of the lab, you will implement a program to parse date strings formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD" into Date objects. You will also create a corresponding test suite to validate your implementation.

### Your Task:

1. Implement a `parseDate` method which takes a string and returns a corresponding `Date` Object. As you work on this task, think critically about what constitutes legal and illegal inputs. Not every Java string can be parsed as a date; for example, consider the string "hello world". Reflect on edge cases and invalid formats, and ensure your implementation can handle a variety of scenarios appropriately.

2. Write a JUnit test suite to ensure your implementation functions correctly. 

As you proceed, reflect again on our question: What makes a good test suite? 

How does this section differ from the previous one regarding testing? Does implementing the code alongside writing the tests change your perspective on how you approach testing?

### Signing out
Submit both of your test suites and `ParseDate` implementation to Gradescope along with a document reflecting your current thoughts on "What Makes a Good Test Suite". For this lab, there are no definitive right or wrong responses. Next week, we will learn about established test quality metrics. In this assignment, share your insights and observations.

1. Test Suite Quality: 
  a. What qualities contribute to an effective test suite?  
  b. How might you automatically measure these qualities? Is it feasible?  
  
  c. If you aimed to make your test suite as ineffective as possible, what changes would you make?  
  d. How did you determine when you had tested sufficiently?  

3. Writing Test Suites:  
  a. What was the most challenging aspect of creating your test suite?  
  b. Did you find it easier to write tests for code that you had authored?  
  c. In Part 2, did you write your tests before or after the implementation? How did that choice affect  your experience? How might things have changed if you had approached it differently?  
  d. How did you derive assertions? Was the process different for each part? How did you ascertain what the expected values should be?  

5. AI Written tests: For this section use ChatGPT (or your favorite AI assistant) to generate tests for both source files.   
  a. Write a few sentences assessing the quality of these AI-generated tests.  
     Do they compile?  
     What are their strengths and weaknesses? What properties do they satisfy or violate?
     Include specific examples where relevant.
